A group of classes to implement the Bayesian Optimisation algorithm. Several
surrogate models and acquisition function apporaches are implemented.

List of classes:

bayesOpt            - User interface class.
acqFcn              - An abstract class defining the acquisition function interface and
                      a template method to maximise the function.
expectedImprovement - Concrete EI acquisition function implementation
ucb                 - Concrete upper confidence bound acquisition function implementation
